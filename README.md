# LaTeX setup 

### Basic Information 

---

Throughout my time using LaTeX I have tested many different
IDE's and resources (MikTeX, Overleaf, Vim+LaTeX, etc); and,
after some time spended managing the packages, snippets,
plugins and everything else, I decided to maintain the setup
Vim+LaTeX for my development. 

After this decision I spent some time configuring and trying
to make LaTeX on Vim not so hard and more dynamic (imho), so
I started modifying my terminal and Vim setup to address
what I was looking for. By doing that, and, with the
**gigantic** help of [Gilles Castel](https://github.com/gillescastel/latex-snippets) and his time spent on learning and improving [how to take notes in mathemical lectures](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) I was able to create my own snippets and, most important, modifying them for my personal use. 

Thus, my objective in creating this repository is not
only to maintain an updated resource for help me, but show
too the modifications that I have made on the work done by
Gilles Castel so far, in order to help others.
